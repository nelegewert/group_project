        Bath Marrow is part of a network of over 50 student groups, with
        hundreds of volunteers in universities across the country, who are all
        working towards one thing - saving the lives of people with blood
        cancer. 1 in 100 students signed up by Marrow groups go on to donate
        lifesaving bone marrow or stem cells to patients with blood cancers and
        other blood disorders.

        Bath Marrow are going to be involved in a multitude of activities in and
        around the university, collaborating with other societies, organizing
        fundraising events and socials as well as are our prime aim of signing
        up over 200 people to the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow register.

          Anthony Nolan was set up in 1974 by Shirley Nolan who desperately needed
          to find a bone marrow donor for her son Anthony. Sadly  Anthony died
          aged seven without a donor being found.

          The unique work of Anthony Nolan has continued ever since, finding
          lifesaving matches for over 14,000 patients – which wouldn’t have been
          possible without the help of our donors and supporters.

          We’ve done some pretty remarkable things…

          Anthony Nolan now has over 700,000 people on the register. Our
          pioneering Research Institute works to improve the success rates of
          transplants. We have a cord blood programme that collects stem cells
          from umbilical cord blood.

          But we still need to do more…

          Every year, 2,000 people in the UK need a transplant from an unrelated
          donor.
