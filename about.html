          Bath Marrow is part of a network of over 50 student groups, with
          hundreds of volunteers in universities across the country, who are all
          working towards one thing - saving the lives of people with blood
          cancer. 1 in 100 students signed up by Marrow groups go on to donate
          lifesaving bone marrow or stem cells to patients with blood cancers and
          other blood disorders.

          Bath Marrow are going to be involved in a multitude of activities in and
          around the university, collaborating with other societies, organizing
          fundraising events and socials as well as are our prime aim of signing
          up over 200 people to the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow register.

            Anthony Nolan was set up in 1974 by Shirley Nolan who desperately needed
            to find a bone marrow donor for her son Anthony. Sadly  Anthony died
            aged seven without a donor being found.

            The unique work of Anthony Nolan has continued ever since, finding
            lifesaving matches for over 14,000 patients – which wouldn’t have been
            possible without the help of our donors and supporters.

            We’ve done some pretty remarkable things…

            Anthony Nolan now has over 700,000 people on the register. Our
            pioneering Research Institute works to improve the success rates of
            transplants. We have a cord blood programme that collects stem cells
            from umbilical cord blood.

            But we still need to do more…

            Every year, 2,000 people in the UK need a transplant from an unrelated
            donor.
